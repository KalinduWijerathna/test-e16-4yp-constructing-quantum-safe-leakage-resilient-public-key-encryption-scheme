# Constructing Quantum-Safe Leakage-Resilient Public-Key Encryption Schemes
___

## Introduction:
Large-scale quantum computers can efficiently solve the hard mathematical problems on
which the security of the Internet is based. Thus, quantum-secure cryptosystems are desirable
for future secure communication. This project aims to build a quantum-secure public-key
encryption system. The prominent feature of the encryption system is that it is secure even in
the presence of partial key leakage, possibly due to side-channel attacks or poor key
management. The project looks at the recent advances in quantum-secure hash proof systems,
a cryptographic object useful in designing key leakage-resilient cryptosystems, and creates
the public-key cryptosystem based upon them.
